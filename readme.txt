Population

- Your city's population is the heartbeat of your urban center. Every second, they contribute a small portion of their earnings as taxes to the city.   Over the span of a minute, these contributions add to your city's financial balance. For example, if you have 50 Population, in just a minute, you'll see an additional 50 units of currency added to your balance.

Revenue

- Revenue represents the economic flow of your city. Each second, it generates a fraction of profit, from which the city collects a share. Over the   course of a minute, this revenue stream contributes to your financial balance. For instance, if you have 50 Revenue, in a minute, you'll witness 50 more currency units added to your balance.

Maintenance

- Maintenance costs are the necessary expenses for keeping your city in good shape. Roads and large buildings, in particular, require regular  maintenance, leading to a reduction in your balance over the minute. For instance, if you have 50 Maintenance, in a minute, you'll see 5 units of balance deducted to cover these upkeep costs.
